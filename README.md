# one-mcat-deck-to-rule-them-all

### Updates:
12-18-2025: Added some organic chemistry nomenclature cards
12-15-2025: Includes general chemistry review content and a few errant biology cards

### How to use:
1. Download the .apkg file
2. Clicking on the .apkg file after downloading should auto-import if you have Anki desktop installed
  * Don't have Anki desktop? Download it here: https://apps.ankiweb.net
3. If it does not auto import, you can manually import from the Anki desktop application: https://docs.ankiweb.net/importing/intro.html

### Updating the deck:

Because this is an .apkg file, it does _not_ contain any scheduling information for the cards. If you download a newer copy from the repository, Anki will update your local deck with the changes made. However, if you have edited any of the cards and the updated .apkg file has no changes for those cards, your changes will be retained. See the Anki docs here: https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html#deck-apkg

### Found a problem?
Please file a GitHub issue and include the original text of the card as well as a description of the error (and a proposed fix if you have one). Anki internal card IDs seem to not be guaranteed to stay consistent across diferent users' versions of the same deck, so providing a card ID is not enough info.

### This deck is provided with no warranty or guarantee of correctness. If something seems incorrect/like a typo, verify it against an external source before committing it to long term memory. If you feel nice, you could even file an issue and let me know :)
